# Data Cleaning Project

This repository contains a comprehensive notebook for **data cleaning** as part of the Dibimbing assignment. The goal is to prepare raw data into a clean and structured format suitable for analysis or modeling.

## 📁 File Structure

- `Data Cleaning.ipynb` — Main Jupyter notebook that includes:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Handling missing values
  - Encoding categorical variables
  - Outlier detection and removal
  - Feature scaling (StandardScaler, etc.)

## 🔧 Techniques Used

- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for preprocessing:
  - Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding
  - Standard Scaling
- Missing value imputation (mean, median, or drop)
- Outlier handling (IQR method or Z-score)

## 📊 Objective

Clean and transform the dataset to be analysis-ready by:
- Ensuring data consistency
- Removing irrelevant or duplicated data
- Encoding and scaling appropriately
- Preparing for modeling or visualization

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RasyidDevs/Data-Cleaning.git
   cd Data-Cleaning
   jupyter notebook "Data Cleaning.ipynb"
